Exploratory Data Analysis of Government Procurement Trends (2021–2022)

📋 Project Overview
This project dives into government procurement data from 2021–2022, aiming to uncover public spending trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA). We used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and statistical techniques to gain insights into procurement categories, departments, tender methods, value distributions, and seasonal activity.

📈 Key Analyses Conducted
Procurement Category Analysis
→ Analyzed major procurement categories (Goods, Services, Works).

Top Departments Analysis
→ Heatmap showing department-wise procurement patterns.

Procurement Method Analysis
→ Pie chart distribution of tendering methods (Open, Limited, Direct).

Tender Value Distribution & Outlier Detection
→ Boxplots and Shapiro-Wilk test to assess financial scale and distribution normality.

Monthly Tender Trends & Correlation Analysis
→ Time series trends and correlation heatmaps among numerical features.

🛠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

Tools: Jupyter Notebook

📊Dataset Details
Source: data.gov.in

Standard: Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)

Period Covered: Fiscal Year 2021–2022

Features: Tender amount, buyer department, procurement category, tender method, tender publication date

🔍 Key Findings
Majority of tenders fall under "Goods" category.

Open Tendering was the most widely used procurement method.

Departments like Health, Education, and Infrastructure had the most procurement activity.

Significant seasonal spike towards the fiscal year-end.

Tender value distribution was non-normal with notable high-value outliers.

🔮 Future Scope
Analyze multi-year procurement trends.

Apply predictive analytics to forecast procurement needs.

Integrate socio-economic indicators for impact analysis.
